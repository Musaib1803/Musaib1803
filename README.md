- 👋 Hi, I’m @Musaib1803  
- 👀 I’m interested in cross-platform mobile development, .NET MAUI, Xamarin, and modern app architectures  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced .NET MAUI features and exploring Blazor Hybrid apps  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mobile app migrations, performance optimizations, and scalable front-end solutions
